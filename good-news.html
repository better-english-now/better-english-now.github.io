Right now.</strong> At this precise moment. There you go. Done. It really is that easy to set a goal. If you let it be easy, and don't complicate matters by trying convince yourself that it is OK to do nothing.</p><p>Now you have a goal, you need to determine your route to achieving it. There are slower routes and faster routes.</p><p><strong>If you are already at an intermediate stage then the fastest way to move up is with paid one-to-one English tuition</strong>, direct from an experienced teacher whose goal is for you to make as much progress as possible as fast as possible. I have a recommendation... me.</p><p>I've put some videos on YouTube to explain how I do my one-to-one lessons. They are not there to teach you English, that's what the lessons are for. It is well worth watching the videos and thinking about whether you want to go for one-to-one lessons, but you will need to steer well clear of the unrealistic YouTube-fuelled mentality that wants everything to look good and be instantaneous, easy and free. <strong>Learning a language, I mean <em>really </em>learning, and fast, requires you to do more than passively watch free videos, however pretty they might be.</strong> You'll know this if you have tried that route.</p><p>Are you looking for something better?</p><p>If so, go to <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbV52hEsmWcSjiT_CGQVbbw" style="color: #e03e2d;">1-2-1 ENGLISH LESSONS NOW</a></strong></span> on YouTube. If you like the sound of what I offer, then the next step is to book a free trial lesson. A lot of people who have a trial lesson do go on to take paid tuition with me, but there's absolutely no obligation. Only if you feel that it will work for you. That is, of course, the whole point of a trial. Hope to see you sometime soon.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbV52hEsmWcSjiT_CGQVbbw" aria-label="Youtube"><svg><use xlink:href="https://better-english-now.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbV52hEsmWcSjiT_CGQVbbw">1-2-1 ENGLISH LESSONS NOW</a> on YouTube</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://better-english-now.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
