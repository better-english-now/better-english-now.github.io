Right now.</strong> At this precise moment. There you go. Done. It really is that easy to set a goal. But you need to let it be easy, and not complicate matters by trying convince yourself that it is OK to do nothing.</p><p>Now you have a goal. So now you need to decide on a route to achieving it. There are slower routes and faster routes.</p><p><strong>If you are an</strong><strong> intermediate speaker of English, then by far the fastest route is with good quality, paid, one-to-one English lessons. </strong>But you need to find an experienced teacher whose goal is for you to make as much progress as possible, as fast as possible. You need to find a teacher who is genuinely interested in the job, and not primarily motivated by the money. And on the subject of money, if you deal directly with the teacher, rather than a platform, then you will get better value. It always makes sense not to pay a middle-man if at all possible.</p><p>And it's a good idea not to get infected by the unrealistic Internet-fuelled mentality that wants everything to look good, to be instantaneous, to be easy, and to be free. <strong>Learning a language, I mean <em>really </em>learning, and fast, requires you to do more than passively watch free videos, however pretty they might be.</strong> You'll know this if you have tried that route.</p><p>Are you looking for something truly effective? Something that activates the English you already know, and that rapidly increases your ability to communicate effectively?</p><p>Yes?</p><p>Maybe?</p><p>Then go to <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbV52hEsmWcSjiT_CGQVbbw" style="color: #e03e2d;">1-2-1 ENGLISH LESSONS NOW</a></strong></span> on YouTube. The four videos that you will find there are not there to teach you English. They are there to explain how one-to-one lessons can work and what you can get out of them.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbV52hEsmWcSjiT_CGQVbbw" aria-label="Youtube"><svg><use xlink:href="https://better-english-now.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbV52hEsmWcSjiT_CGQVbbw">1-2-1 ENGLISH LESSONS NOW</a> on YouTube</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://better-english-now.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
